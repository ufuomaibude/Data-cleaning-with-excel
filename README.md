# Skin Cancer Analysis with SQL
Skin cancer is a widespread and potentially fatal condition, but early detection can significantly boost survival chances.
Through  a structured dataset and digital resources we analyse factors like patient demographics, environmental influences, and lesion traits, generating data-driven insights to aid dermatologists in identifying and managing early-stage cases.

AIMS 
Improve early diagnosis and treatment of skin cancer with clinical dermatology insights.
Uncover significant relationships between demographics, environmental exposure, and specific lesion traits to enhance diagnostic accuracy.
Empower healthcare professionals and researchers with actionable insights that support early diagnostic decisions and broader public health interventions.
Organize a comprehensive skin lesion dataset to support detailed data analysis and model development.

OBJECTIVES
Assemble and maintain a structured dataset (including 1,089 skin lesion cases) for efficient SQL-based querying.
Analyze variables such as gender, age groups, environmental exposures (e.g., pesticide exposure, sewage access), and clinical features (e.g., bleeding, size, biopsy frequency) to determine their impact on skin cancer risk.
Ensure the data organization supports the identification of key patterns linking lesion characteristics with patient demographics and environmental risk factors.
Answer targeted research questions regarding lesion distribution, biopsy rates, and the impact of risk factors (including smoking and environmental conditions) on lesion characteristics.


INTRODUCTION TO SKIN CANCER AND LESION
A lesion is any abnormal change or damage to the skin or body tissue, such as a spot, bump, sore, or discolored patch. Lesions can be benign (harmless), malignant (cancerous), or pre-cancerous.
In skin cancer detection, changes in a lesion’s size, shape, color, texture, or symptoms like bleeding, itching, pain, or non-healing raise concern. A biopsied lesion is one that has been partially or fully removed for microscopic examination (biopsy) to determine if it's cancerous.
Common lesion locations include the face, back, chest, lips, and ears, with some areas more likely to be biopsied due to higher cancer risks. Risk factors include age, family history, pesticide exposure, and poor sanitation.

## Summary of Insights

This dataset presents a multi-dimensional view of skin cancer, categorized by demographics, environmental exposure, and lesion characteristics to different types of skin cancer. 
The skin cancer dataset shows that certain signs like bleeding, growing, and painful skin lesions are strong reasons why doctors decide to perform a biopsy. The size and where the lesion appear on the body also play a big role, especially if the lesion is large or in a visible area.

The results show that most lesions are commonly found on the face, chest, back, and forearm, these are areas often exposed to the sun. However, doctors are more likely to biopsy lesions found on the lips, nose, ears, and neck. 

Other factors like age, family history, exposure to harmful chemicals like pesticides, and lack of clean water or sanitation also increase the chances of needing a biopsy. Altogether, this information helps researchers and doctors understand skin cancer better and also helps build smarter AI tools by using clean, well-organized data that combines personal, medical, and environmental risks.

This may be so because these areas are more sensitive or because skin cancer in these spots tends to be more serious. It also shows that doctors may be more cautious with lesions in these places, even if they don’t appear often.
